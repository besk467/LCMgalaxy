## Purpose of this repository This serves as a common place for
communicating changes on the codebase, and as a central "source of
truth".  We should strive to make the *master* branch always compile
correctly and (hopefully) be the "right thing to get".  Any ongoing
work should be in a side branch or fork.

To do that for those of you less familiar with git:

Get the latest-and-greatest with `git fetch` or `git pull`.  Create
your own branch with `git branch branch-name`, then switch to it with
`git checkout branch-name` (you can see which branches you have with
`git branch`).  When you've made some changes, add the changed files
with `git add filename`, this can be done from any sub-directory
within the project directory.  If you're happy with your changes, `git
commit` adds them to your *local* copy of the repo (you'll be asked to
give a brief description).  If you're on your own branch, you can go
ahead and push it to the main repo with `git push`.  When you're ready
to commit to the main branch, let Rob or Rich know for further
directions.
